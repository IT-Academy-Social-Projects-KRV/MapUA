## Backend

You need **node.js** (preferably LTS version and at least Node.js â‰¥ v10.5.0). Also, in this project we are using **yarn** package manager.  
To run backend, you can use **docker** installed on your machine as well.

### Steps to start backend locally

1. cd backend/
2. yarn install to install all packages
3. yarn start to run local server (default port is 3001)
4. Done!

### Technologies Used

- **express** - a web framework for node.js;
- **mongoose** - an ODM for MongoDB  
  and more, this list will be updated in the near future...
